# Holo-Book
CIS4914-Senior Project<br />
Project Holo-Book is an augmented reality storytelling platform that combines a
physical book with a video game using a projection of the gameâ€™s characters and interactable
features onto the scenery depicted on the book. In this increasingly digital age, it has become
harder to capture the attention of the younger generations with traditionally physical storytelling
media. Through this combination of the physical book and game projection into a new hybrid
medium, we wish for players to have a more immersive and engaging experience similar to
traditional choose your own adventure books with specific features that integrate video game
features with tangible, physical change. Some of these physical features are ones such as holes in
pages to signify hidden areas for further exploration or bridges that fold down from the page
above to let the player traverse the world in different ways.
