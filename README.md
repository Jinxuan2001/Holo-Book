# Holo-Book
CIS4914-Senior Project
Project Holo-Book is the prototype for an interactive storytelling game system using
AR elements to integrate it with physical media in the form of a “choose your own adventure”
style book. This specific implementation will take place in the form of an isometric top down
style adventure game where the player will complete puzzles and explore the world while
interacting with the pages of the book to change the world.
